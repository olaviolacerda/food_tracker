## Food Tracker

A simple Flutter app for recording and listing orders/food items. This repository demonstrates a small order-tracking app that uses Providers for state management and includes screens for adding and viewing orders.

### Key features

- Create new orders
- List existing orders
- Basic navigation between main screens (home, add order, orders list)

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (follow the version in `pubspec.yaml`)
- Platform-specific tools for your target (Xcode for iOS/macOS, Android SDK for Android)

### Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

   flutter pub get

2. Run on an emulator or device:

   flutter run

3. Build releases:

   flutter build apk # Android
   flutter build ios # iOS (macOS with Xcode)

### Tests

Run the test suite with:

flutter test

### Notes on the code

The app uses Provider for state management. The code is intentionally simple; inspect the `lib/` folder to see models, providers and screens.
